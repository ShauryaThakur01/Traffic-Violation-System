• Developed a Traffic Violation which is able to check if a vehicle is violating any traffic light, not wearing helmet, triple riding on bike and detects number plate which is stored in a database.
• The project utilizes YOLO V3 model and OpenCV.

Note:- I was not able to deploy the whole project including processed videos due to its huge size so, I have uploaded images of the videos of the project in the Project Images folder.
